# BDDoc - BDD Documentation  
*Writing test cases for BDD, generate your documentation running your tests and keep it tied to your code*

##Intro
The idea to develop **BDDoc** comes from the need to write tests for BDD using an easy approach and keep the documentation tied to the source code. 
Having either a documentation file or textual DSL may lead to scenario where the documentation is out of sync with the source code.

BDDoc can be used with *any testing framework* (Currently tested with MSTest and NUnit). 
A story is implemented as a class whilst the scenarios of the story are implemented as methods.
The only requirements to be satisfied by the story implementation are three:
* IStory Interface: *Story has to implement IStory interface*
* BDDoc Attributes: *Story and the scenario methods have to be decorated using the BDDoc attributes*
* Code your steps: *The scenario implementation has to create a BDDoc's scenario instance and to code steps (Given/And/When/Then)*

##Usage

####Create a BDDoc Test
..

######BDDoc Test Sample
..

####Generate documentation using BDDocGenerator
..

#######BDDocGenerator Sample

##Source Code
BDDoc has been developed using VisualStudio 2013, c# and .NET Framework 4.0

####Solution
In the source code you can find two Visual Studio Solutions:
- **BDDoc.sln** (src/BDDoc.sln )
    - This solution contains two projects:
        - BDDoc: It is the library to be referenced by Test projects
        - BDDocGenerator: Utility to be used to generate HTML documentation starting from the xml output generated by BDDoc
- **BDDoc.Samples.sln** (samples/BDDoc.Samples.sln)
    - This solution implements a sample project which contain an exemple of BDDoc Test
