# BDDoc - BDD Documentation  
Write your tests using BDD, generate your documentation running your tests and keep it tied to your code

##Intro
The idea to develop BDDoc comes from the need to write test using BDD and keep the documentation tied to the source code. 
Having either a documentation file or textual DSL can lead to scenario where the documentation is out of sync with the source code.
