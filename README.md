# BDDoc - BDD Documentation  
*Writing test cases for BDD, generate your documentation running your tests and keep it tied to your code*

##Intro
The idea to develop **BDDoc** comes from the need to write tests for BDD using an easy approach and keep the documentation tied to the source code. 
Having either a documentation file or textual DSL may lead to cases where the documentation is out of sync with the source code.

BDDoc can be used with *any testing framework* (Currently tested with MSTest and NUnit).
A story is implemented as a class whilst the scenarios of the story are implemented as methods.
The only requirements to be satisfied by the story implementation are three:
* **IStory Interface:** *Story has to implement IStory interface*
* **BDDoc Attributes:** *Story and the scenario methods have to be decorated using the BDDoc attributes*
* **Code your steps:** *The scenario implementation has to create a BDDoc's scenario instance and to code steps (Given/And/When/Then)*

##Usage

####Create a BDDoc Test
..

######BDDoc Test Sample
..

####Generate documentation using BDDocGenerator
..

#######BDDocGenerator Sample
..


##Source Code
BDDoc has been developed using VisualStudio 2013, c# and .NET Framework 4.0

####Solution
The project contains two Visual Studio Solutions:
- **BDDoc.sln** (src/BDDoc.sln )
    - This solution contains two projects:
        - BDDoc: It is the library to be referenced by Test projects
        - BDDocGenerator: Utility to be used to generate HTML documentation starting from the xml output generated by BDDoc
- **BDDoc.Samples.sln** (samples/BDDoc.Samples.sln)
    - This solution implements a sample project which contain an exemple of BDDoc Test

####BUILD
BDDoc.Samples solution depend by BDDoc, as its projects are referencing the
BDDoc dll from the output dir (Output dir is generated by using the MSBuild file names BDDoc.targets).

Project contains a Build.cmd which build the BDDoc solution by mean of the BDDoc.targets file and generate the application's artifacts (such as output folder etc).

######Compile
In order to compile execute the following commands via command line:

*DEBUG CONFIGURATION*
```
build
build -samples
```

*RELEASE CONFIGURATION*

```
build -r
build -samples -r
```

Once executed two folder will be created:
- **output/libs**: *This folder contains the BDDoc Dll and BDDocGenerator Utility*
- **output-samples/documentation/html**: This folder contains the HTML documentation generated automatically

######Clean
In order to clean the solution and artifacts created, execute the following commands via command line:

*DEBUG Configuration*
```
build clean
build -samples clean
```

*RELEASE Configuration*

```
build clean
build -samples clean
```
