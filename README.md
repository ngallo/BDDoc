# BDDoc - BDD Documentation  
*Writing test cases for BDD, generate your documentation running your tests and keep it tied to your code*

##Intro
The idea to develop **BDDoc** comes from the need to write tests for BDD using an easy approach and keep the documentation tied to the source code. 
Having either a documentation file or textual DSL may lead to cases where the documentation and source code are out of sync.

BDDoc can be used with *any testing framework* (Currently tested with MSTest and NUnit).
A story is implemented as a class whilst the scenarios of the story are implemented as methods.
The only requirements to be satisfied by the story implementation are three:
* **IStory Interface:** *Story has to implement IStory interface*
* **BDDoc Attributes:** *Story and the scenarios have to be decorated using the BDDoc attributes*
* **Code your steps:** *The scenario implementation has to create a BDDoc's scenario instance and to code steps (Given/And/When/Then)*

##Usage

####BDDoc
..


####BDDocGenerator
..

##Source Code
BDDoc has been developed using VisualStudio 2013, c# and .NET Framework 4.0

####Solution
The project contains two Visual Studio Solutions:
- **BDDoc.sln** (src/BDDoc.sln )
    - This solution contains two projects:
        - BDDoc: It is the library to be referenced by Test projects
        - BDDocGenerator: Utility to be used to generate HTML documentation starting from the xml output generated by BDDoc
- **BDDoc.Samples.sln** (samples/BDDoc.Samples.sln)
    - This solution implements a sample project which contain an exemple of BDDoc Test

####BUILD
BDDoc.Samples solution depend by BDDoc, as its projects are referencing the
BDDoc dll which is in the output folder (Output folder is generated by using the MSBuild file named BDDoc.targets).

The project contains a **build.cmd** file which compile the BDDoc solution and generate the application's artifacts (such as output folder etc) by means of the BDDoc.targets file.

######Compile
Execute following commands via command line in order to compile both solutions:

*DEBUG CONFIGURATION*
```
REM Compile BDDoc.sln
build

REM Compile BDDoc.Samples.sln
build -samples
```

*RELEASE CONFIGURATION*
```
REM Compile BDDoc.sln
build -r

REM Compile BDDoc.Samples.sln
build -samples -r
```

Two folders will be created once executed the commands listed above:
- **output/libs**: *This folder contains the BDDoc Dll and BDDocGenerator Utility*
- **output-samples/documentation/html**: This folder contains the HTML documentation generated automatically

######Clean
Execute following commands via command line in order to clean both solutions and artifacts created:

*DEBUG Configuration*
```
REM Clean BDDoc.sln
build clean

REM Clean BDDoc.Samples.sln
build -samples clean
```

*RELEASE Configuration*
```
REM Clean BDDoc.sln
build clean

REM Clean BDDoc.Samples.sln
build -samples clean
```

**NOTE**: **Build.sh** *file can be used via Git Bash instead of the build.cmd file.*
```
bash build.sh -r
bash build.sh -samples -r
```
