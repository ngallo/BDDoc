# BDDoc - BDD Documentation  
Writing test cases for BDD, generate your documentation running your tests and keep it tied to your code

##Intro
The idea to develop BDDoc comes from the need to write tests for BDD using an easy approach and keep the documentation tied to the source code. 
Having either a documentation file or textual DSL may lead to scenario where the documentation is out of sync with the source code.

BDDoc can be used with any testing framework, writing your story the only requirements to satisfy are three:
* **Implement IStory interface**
* **Decorate your story with BDDoc attributes**
* **Create a scenario instance and code your steps**
